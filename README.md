Elon Musk's idea of saving the world from climate change was going green. And by going green I do not mean just recycling or reusing, but changing the whole automobile industry and driving on electricity instead of gas. He is challanging a nearly 250 billion dollar auto industry but thats not the most facinating thing about this company. As a Computer Science student I a huge enthusiast of innovation and the use of technology. Tesla Motors is the biggest self driving car company in the world right now with a market capitalization of over 100 billion dollars. 

## Five reasons why Tesla will be the biggest car company in the future

**1. It is an all electric car **

The sound of the car which runs on engine is pleasing to the eyes but we will run out of fuel one day and going full electric will be the only option for all the car companies. In this case Tesla is way ahead of any other car company.
